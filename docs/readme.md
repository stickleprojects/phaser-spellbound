- Used to be single-screen, now scrolling multi-platformer!!

- how to get characters to wonder around the place?

Too boring if stuck on a platform on a floor, but that means we would have to implement jump for those characters or some alternative to allow them to move around a floor

- how to implement the lift?

you cannot move between floors, so you must use the lift

- how to implement energy?

Used to be per-screen, now we must track footsteps or similar
